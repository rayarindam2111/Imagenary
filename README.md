# Imagenary
A virtual keyboard+mouse system based on Image Processing built using OpenCV.

Using a properly placed camera and an image of a keyboard printed on paper, Imagenary uses a finger tracking mechanism to detect the position of the fingers on the paper keyboard and simulate keypresses. Mouse clicks can also be synthesized using a similar mechanism, thus creating a completely wireless, robust input system.
